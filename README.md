# Lego x COVID
A little joke project. It tracts the number of new cases of COVID-19 in Poland and displays a historic Lego brick set with such serial number. Along with some additional info.

May be buggy as hell but, ya know, that's not the point.

### You can see it in action [HERE](https://io.jantoni.pl/legoxcovid).
